# Clustering-Algorithm---Machine-Learning
Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points into clusters or groups. Unlike supervised learning, clustering does not require labeled data. The goal of clustering is to categorize data in such a way that data points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. 
Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points into clusters or groups. Unlike supervised learning, clustering does not require labeled data. The goal of clustering is to categorize data in such a way that data points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. It is widely used in various applications, including customer segmentation, anomaly detection, image compression, and more.

In the context of machine learning, clustering algorithms aim to identify underlying patterns or structures in data without prior knowledge of the labels. Some common clustering algorithms include:

K-means Clustering: This algorithm partitions the data into K clusters, where K is a predefined number. It assigns data points to the cluster whose centroid is closest. The process iterates until convergence, where the centroids no longer change.

Hierarchical Clustering: This method builds a tree of clusters, either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down). It is useful when the number of clusters is not known in advance and when data structure is hierarchical.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): This algorithm is based on density. It groups data points that are closely packed together, marking points that lie alone in low-density regions as outliers.

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): GMM assumes that data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. It uses probabilities to assign data points to clusters, allowing for more flexibility than K-means.

Clustering is useful in exploring datasets, understanding hidden patterns, and making data-driven decisions, especially in cases where labels are not available.
