# Clustering-Algorithm---Machine-Learning
Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points into clusters or groups. Unlike supervised learning, clustering does not require labeled data. The goal of clustering is to categorize data in such a way that data points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.
